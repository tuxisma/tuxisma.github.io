          What is Infrastructure as code Why is so important What is Terraform Features of terraform Use Cases  What is Infrastructure as code Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a way of how you define the resources that you want to deploy as code. IaC helps to build, change, version your infrastructure at low-level (Compute instances, storage, networking) and high-level(DNS entries, SaaS features).
Why is so important The traditional way of provision a compute instance is via Ticket services such as Service Now, so the user raises a ticket and then the sys admin takes that ticket and provision that compute instance through a GUI Service or maybe using the CLI, so what about if the user needs thousand of compute instances ?

          Three months ago I was learning Docker swarm now I&amp;rsquo;m learning kubernetes as orchestrator this year I&amp;rsquo;m gonna write about k8s a lot so the idea here is show how to deploy Java Aplications within Docker Containers orchestra them with Kubernetes.
When you run containers you always gonna need a orchestrator in order to be more efficient, faster and continuous delivery and so on that&amp;rsquo;s the reason why I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen kubernetes and the true is basically because is the most popular I would say it&amp;rsquo;s so robust, ambicious, fault-tolerance, scaling, discovery abilities and why not use it, mainly was created at Google and now is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation(CNCF).
