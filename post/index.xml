      <description>Three months ago I was learning Docker swarm now I&amp;rsquo;m learning kubernetes as orchestrator this year I&amp;rsquo;m gonna write about k8s a lot so the idea here is show how to deploy Java Aplications within Docker Containers orchestra them with Kubernetes.
When you run containers you always gonna need a orchestrator in order to be more efficient, faster and continuous delivery and so on that&amp;rsquo;s the reason why I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen kubernetes and the true is basically because is the most popular I would say it&amp;rsquo;s so robust, ambicious, fault-tolerance, scaling, discovery abilities and why not use it, mainly was created at Google and now is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation(CNCF).</description>
